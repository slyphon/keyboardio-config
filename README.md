# Keyboardio Config

I exported these manually from Chrysalis.app (not sure if there's a better way, but i figured this was the quickest).

This layout is attempting to be more kinesis like, and to put the modifier keys in a more traditional location. I found it to greatly reduce the cognitive load in switching from my venerable old kinesis ergo to this newfangled thing.

Hope it's useful.
